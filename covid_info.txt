taipei (taiwan news) — the central epidemic command center (cecc) issued new quarantine guidelines for covid cases, travelers arriving from overseas, and contacts of covid cases. It also announced that it will end the quarantine requirement for close contacts of covid cases who have received a third dose of the covid vaccine. For covid cases (tested positive), they are required to do a 7+7 plan. People diagnosed with COVID who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms can enter home care for seven days. People in high-risk groups will be transported to a government-appointed quarantine facility, while those with moderate-to-severe symptoms will be admitted to a hospital. Following the seven days of home care, COVID cases then begin seven days of self-health management. During this phase, people can venture outside the home without taking a rapid antigen test but cannot go to crowded places, restaurants, gatherings, or other social activities. As for overseas arrivals, all arrivals from foreign countries must take a COVID test upon arrival. After their seven-day quarantine expires and the COVID test is negative, the seven days of self-health management begins. During the seven days of self-health management, overseas arrivals can venture out of the home without taking a rapid antigen test, but cannot go to crowded places, restaurants, gatherings, or other social activities. For close contacts, defined as relatives, friends, and roommates who live in the same residence of covid cases, who have received three COVID vaccine doses will be able to avoid quarantine under the "0+7" plan, they no longer need to undergo three days of home isolation and instead can directly begin seven days of self-initiated epidemic prevention. During the seven days of self-initiated epidemic prevention, contacts who have had booster shots must have tested negative on a rapid antigen kit within the past two days if they wish to venture out. When going out, in the self-initiated epidemic prevention phase, they should wear a mask and maintain proper social distancing at all times. If they develop symptoms, they should rest at home and take a rapid antigen test.  If any violations are discovered, the violators will be prosecuted according to the law. Individuals observing the self-initiated epidemic prevention stage are discouraged from going out unless absolutely necessary, and they must have proof of a negative test result on a rapid antigen kit within the past two days. People undergoing this stage are prohibited from dining in restaurants, eating at banquets, attending social gatherings, entering crowded venues, and coming in contact with unfamiliar people.
